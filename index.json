Cloud enables access to a shared pool of virtual resources hosted in large energy-hungry data centers for diverse information and communication services with dynamic workloads. The huge energy consumption of cloud data centers results in high electricity bills as well as emission of a large amount of carbon dioxide gas. Needless to say, efficient resource management in cloud environments has become one of the most important priorities of cloud providers and consequently has increased the interest of researchers to propose novel energy saving solutions. This chapter presents a scientific and taxonomic survey of recent energy efficient cloud resource management' solutions in cloud environments. The main objective of this study is to propose a novel complete taxonomy for energy-efficient cloud resource management solutions, review recent research advancements in this area, classify the existing techniques based on our proposed taxonomy, and open up new research directions. Besides, it reviews and surveys the literature in the range of 2015 through 2021 in the subject of energy-efficient cloud resource management techniques and maps them to its proposed taxonomy, which unveils novel research directions and facilitates the conduction of future researches.","tags":["Computer Science - Distributed","Parallel","and Cluster Computing"],"title":"Recent Advances in Energy Efficient Resource Management Techniques in Cloud Computing Environments","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Niloofar Gholipour","Niloufar Shoeibi","Ehsan Arianyan"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1656082277,"objectID":"de21780ee77260595883c21add2dad8b","permalink":"https://niloofargholipour.github.io/publication/gholipour-energy-aware-2021/","publishdate":"2022-06-24T14:51:17.501476Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gholipour-energy-aware-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"These days by a high increase in the amount of computation and big data gathering and analysis, everybody needs more resources. Buying more computational and storage resources are so expensive. However, cloud computing solved this problem by providing a ‚Äúpay as you go‚Äù plans therefor, users will only pay for resources that they used. However, using this technology has its challenges. One of them is resource management, which is focusing on the methodologies of dedicating resources to the users with the minimum of waste. In this paper, we propose a novel energy-aware resource management technique, using the concepts of both joint VM and container consolidation approach and deep Q-Learning algorithm for green computing in cloud data centers in order to minimize the waste of resources, migration rate, and energy.","tags":[],"title":"An Energy-Aware Dynamic Resource Management Technique Using Deep Q-Learning Algorithm and Joint VM and Container Consolidation Approach for Green Computing in Cloud Data Centers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Niloofar Gholipour","Ehsan Arianyan","Rajkumar Buyya"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1604188800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1656082277,"objectID":"71ce00c8248bdb5009341e359a381d87","permalink":"https://niloofargholipour.github.io/publication/gholipour-novel-2020/","publishdate":"2022-06-24T14:51:17.078711Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gholipour-novel-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Cloud computing is being rapidly adopted for managing IT services as a notable solution due to diverse beneficiaries such as automatically optimized resource management as well as modern service delivery models. The container as a service has been recently introduced by cloud providers as a new service apart from traditional cloud services. Containers enable applications to run and deploy on isolated virtual space, and the operating system kernel is shared among them. Also, containerization has some attributes such as scalability, highly portable properties, and lightweight, for those reasons, it is applied for running isolated applications. Reducing energy consumption, as well as their CO2 emissions, are great deals for cloud providers. In this direction, consolidation is recommended as a vital energy-aware approach in cloud data centers. Previously, independent virtual machine migration or container migration was proposed in the literature for green computing in cloud data centers. However, this paper proposes a new cloud resource management procedure based on a multi-criteria decision-making method that takes advantage of a joint virtual machine and container migration approach concurrently. The results of simulations using ContainerCloudsim simulator validates the applicability of the proposed approach which shows notable reductions in energy consumption, SLA violation, and number of migrations in comparison with the state-of-the-art algorithms.","tags":["Cloud computing","Consolidation","Containerization","Datacenter","Energy consumption","Resource management"],"title":"A novel energy-aware resource management technique using joint VM and container consolidation approach for green computing in cloud data centers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Niloofar Gholipour","Âê≥ÊÅ©ÈÅî"],"categories":["Demo","ÊïôÁ®ã"],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.
