abstract: Cloud computing is being rapidly adopted for managing IT services as a notable
  solution due to diverse beneficiaries such as automatically optimized resource management
  as well as modern service delivery models. The container as a service has been recently
  introduced by cloud providers as a new service apart from traditional cloud services.
  Containers enable applications to run and deploy on isolated virtual space, and
  the operating system kernel is shared among them. Also, containerization has some
  attributes such as scalability, highly portable properties, and lightweight, for
  those reasons, it is applied for running isolated applications. Reducing energy
  consumption, as well as their CO2 emissions, are great deals for cloud providers.
  In this direction, consolidation is recommended as a vital energy-aware approach
  in cloud data centers. Previously, independent virtual machine migration or container
  migration was proposed in the literature for green computing in cloud data centers.
  However, this paper proposes a new cloud resource management procedure based on
  a multi-criteria decision-making method that takes advantage of a joint virtual
  machine and container migration approach concurrently. The results of simulations
  using ContainerCloudsim simulator validates the applicability of the proposed approach
  which shows notable reductions in energy consumption, SLA violation, and number
  of migrations in comparison with the state-of-the-art algorithms.
