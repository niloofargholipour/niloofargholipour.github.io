abstract: Nowadays cloud computing adoption as a form of hosted application and services
  is widespread due to decreasing costs of hardware, software, and maintenance. Cloud
  enables access to a shared pool of virtual resources hosted in large energy-hungry
  data centers for diverse information and communication services with dynamic workloads.
  The huge energy consumption of cloud data centers results in high electricity bills
  as well as emission of a large amount of carbon dioxide gas. Needless to say, efficient
  resource management in cloud environments has become one of the most important priorities
  of cloud providers and consequently has increased the interest of researchers to
  propose novel energy saving solutions. This chapter presents a scientific and taxonomic
  survey of recent energy efficient cloud resource management' solutions in cloud
  environments. The main objective of this study is to propose a novel complete taxonomy
  for energy-efficient cloud resource management solutions, review recent research
  advancements in this area, classify the existing techniques based on our proposed
  taxonomy, and open up new research directions. Besides, it reviews and surveys the
  literature in the range of 2015 through 2021 in the subject of energy-efficient
  cloud resource management techniques and maps them to its proposed taxonomy, which
  unveils novel research directions and facilitates the conduction of future researches.
