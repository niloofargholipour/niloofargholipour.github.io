abstract: These days by a high increase in the amount of computation and big data
  gathering and analysis, everybody needs more resources. Buying more computational
  and storage resources are so expensive. However, cloud computing solved this problem
  by providing a “pay as you go” plans therefor, users will only pay for resources
  that they used. However, using this technology has its challenges. One of them is
  resource management, which is focusing on the methodologies of dedicating resources
  to the users with the minimum of waste. In this paper, we propose a novel energy-aware
  resource management technique, using the concepts of both joint VM and container
  consolidation approach and deep Q-Learning algorithm for green computing in cloud
  data centers in order to minimize the waste of resources, migration rate, and energy.
