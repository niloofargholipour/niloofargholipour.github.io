I am a Ph.D. student at Ecole de Technologie Superieure (ETS), Montreal, working on resource management techniques using Reinforcement Learning approach, supervised by <a href="https://www.marcosassuncao.com/"> Prof. Marcos Dias De Assuncao </a>, <a href="http://www.juliengs.ca/"> Prof. Julien Gascon-Samson </a>, and <a href="http://www.buyya.com/"> Prof. Rajkumar Buyya </a>. Before joining ETS, I was a researcher at Iran Telecommunication Research Center(ITRC), 2020-2022. During my Master's, I was a research Development Intern at ITRC, supervised by <a href="https://ir.linkedin.com/in/ehsan-arianyan-7a9b3349"> Prof. Ehsan Arianyan </a>. 

I completed my Master's thesis in January 2019, in the topic of Energy-aware resource management technique considering performance in cloud data center. Currently, I have published three research papers during my Master's, collaborating with Prof. Rajkumar Buyya from Melbourne University. Along with my educational experience, I was the IEEE executive member at the Science and Research Branch of Azad University of Tehran (2017-2018) and  Head of public relations in an environmental NGO named Clean Earth Lovers Association (2015-2017). At ETS, I am a core-member of <a href="https://www.womeninairobotics.de/"> Women In AI </a> community.
